# Supplementary material to the Short Course on Agent-Based Modelling & Simulation

The next round of this short course will be conducted from Sep 12th to 16th in Port Elizabeth, South Africa.

We are thankful for being funded by the German Federal Ministry of Research for the project EMSAfrica (FKZ 01LL1801C).

If you are a beginner in working with [MARS](http://www.mars-group.org) or not very much experienced in programming in general it is recommended to work through the tutorials first. 

### WorkshopGrid - start with a basic grid where your agents can move on


### WorkshopGeo - good starting point for working with geodata in your scenarios
